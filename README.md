# CHAMP data analysis
The following R codes support the analysis of data collected by CHAMP, as described in the report "Child body mass index trajectories and disruptive intervention: literature review, data analysis and service evaluation"

A raw data file provided by the Central Manchester Foundation Trust was first reshaped using the file 'CHAMP data reshaping code'
Data quality checks and data cleaning was then completed using file 'BMI data setup'

For questions on the applications of these codes, please contact heather.robinson-2@manchester.ac.uk for support.
